To interchange rows and columns in a matrix, we can make use of nested loops. Here's a Python code snippet that accomplishes this:

```python
def interchange_rows_columns(matrix):
    num_rows = len(matrix)
    num_cols = len(matrix[0])
    
    # Create a new matrix with interchanged rows and columns
    transposed_matrix = [[0 for _ in range(num_rows)] for _ in range(num_cols)]
    
    # Interchange rows and columns
    for i in range(num_rows):
        for j in range(num_cols):
            transposed_matrix[j][i] = matrix[i][j]
    
    return transposed_matrix

# Example usage
matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9]]

result = interchange_rows_columns(matrix)
print(result)
```

This code defines a function `interchange_rows_columns` which takes a matrix as input and returns a new matrix with rows and columns interchanged. We use nested loops to iterate over each element in the original matrix and assign it to the corresponding position in the transposed matrix.

In the example usage, we define a sample matrix and apply the function. The output will be:

```
[[1, 4, 7],
 [2, 5, 8],
 [3, 6, 9]]
```

This is the transposed matrix, where the rows and columns have been interchanged.
